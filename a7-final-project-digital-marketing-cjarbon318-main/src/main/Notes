//Part 1

//1 A customer decides to browse and search for products and services that match their
//needs and wants. The system displaces bundled products and services (solution) as
//well as ads that match customer expectations

//2 The prices must match the customer ability to pay. The product descriptions and ads 
//must speak the customer language. In other words, for different customer types, even
//n the case of the same products and services, the system might display different
// prices, different market messages (bundled solution benefits) will be different. The
// system behaves differently depending on the customer type, market, and channel the
// user is coming through

//3 Configuring products and services as solution bundles targeting different markets and
// channels. Markets, channels, and customer types are configured and populated as well.

// //Part 2

// 5 Create and generate reports to enable
// management to know sales revenues by
// market, channel, ads, and solution bundles
